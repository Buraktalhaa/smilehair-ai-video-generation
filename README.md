This repository contains the production process and outputs of the **AI Powered Video Generation** project, which won **2nd Place** in the Smile Hair Clinic AI & Mobile Hackathon.

Our project combines AI technology with a compelling narrative, emphasizing that hair loss is not just a physical change but a **universal psychological burden** for many individuals. We positioned artificial intelligence not as the end goal, but as a **powerful tool to amplify the story.**

## 🚀 Project Goal
The objective of this project was to use AI technologies to produce an emotionally intense, consistent, and cinematic short video that conveys the psychological effects of hair loss through an empathetic lens.

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **ChatGPT** | Story design, character psychology, and scriptwriting |
| **Gemini Veo** | Generating photorealistic and consistent video scenes |
| **LTX Studio** | Video assembly and scene transitions |
| **CapCut** | Final editing, color grading, and sound design |

## 📖 The Story – Brief Summary
We created a narrative following the internal journeys of three characters experiencing hair loss, caught between societal pressure and loss of self-confidence. The story is structured into 3 parts:

1. **The Concealment:** The moment the character notices the change and the feeling of helplessness.
2. **The Confrontation:** Societal stares and internal monologues.
3. **The Transformation:** Acceptance, seeking solutions, and regaining self-confidence.

Every scene was generated using AI with a focus on consistent facial expressions, color palettes, and environmental atmospheres.
